# Laptop Price Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview  
This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a laptop dataset to understand the factors influencing laptop prices. The dataset includes various features such as hardware specifications (RAM, CPU frequency, storage types), display characteristics (screen resolution, IPS panel, Retina display), brand, operating system, and more.

## Objectives  
- Explore the distribution of laptop prices and key features.  
- Analyze relationships between laptop price and hardware/software specifications.  
- Identify trends and correlations that impact pricing.  
- Provide actionable business insights to guide product development and marketing strategies.

## Tools and Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Analysis Steps  
- Data loading and initial exploration (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`)  
- Univariate analysis of key variables through histograms, pie charts, and countplots  
- Bivariate analysis using boxplots and barplots to compare price across categories  
- Multivariate analysis including correlation heatmaps and pairplots to study feature interactions  
- Visualization of price against numerical features like RAM, CPU frequency, and storage  
- Interpretation of findings with detailed observations and business insights  

## Summary of Findings  
- Laptop price is strongly influenced by RAM size, CPU speed, and storage configuration.  
- Display technologies like IPS panels and Retina displays significantly increase prices.  
- Brand and operating system impact price, with Apple and premium brands commanding higher prices.  
- Touchscreen laptops are generally priced higher than non-touchscreen models.  
- SSD storage is common and preferred in pricier laptops, often combined with hybrid secondary storage.  
- Market segmentation is evident between budget and premium models, guiding product positioning.

## Conclusion  
This EDA provides valuable insights into the laptop market, assisting manufacturers and retailers in optimizing product offerings and pricing strategies. The analysis highlights key areas for competitive advantage through hardware features and brand positioning.
